# Anti-cancer-activity-prediction

Input:
- It is a graph, with atoms representing nodes and bonds as edges.

Output:
- It is a positive against non-small cell lung cancer, or negative otherwise.

Data mining function:
- Classification and prediction because we need to predict positive or negative.

The challenges:
- Upsampling data because the data imbalanced data and extract important features from data file and use some layers to prevent overfitting.

Impact:
- Will this drug affect cancer or not?.

Steps:

1- Reading data.

2- Resampling data.

3- Splitting the training set into train and test

4- Visualizing/Inspecting a Sample

5- Preprocessing(Tokenization, embedded and so on)

6- Trials

Protocol:
- I intend to use hold out method.

Determine good/bad hyper-parameters:
- According to the accuracy graph if there is overfitting or underfitting and then I decided to change hyperparameters or add layers.
